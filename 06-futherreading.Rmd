# Further Reading {#further}

Here are some extra resources researched and shared by the class. 

---

**To add a section, please:**

1) Go to [the repository](https://github.com/jslingsby/data-management) for this web-book on GitHub.
2) Click on the "Fork" button towards the upper right to make your own copy of the repository in your own GitHub profile.
3) In _**your copy**_ of the repository on GitHub (online), open "06-futherreading.Rmd".
4) Copy (don't just edit!) the example text* between the lines below, paste it below the lines, and replace with your link, name, text etc. You don't have to add your name if you don't want to, as long as I know your Git username.
5) Save and add a `commit` message along the lines of "Added new resource under further reading"
6) Next you want to perform a "pull request", which will send a request to me to pull your new code into the main (my) version of the repository. 
  - From your Github repo (not mine!), click on `Pull requests` (top left) and hit the green `New Pull Request` button.
  - Follow the instructions, creating a title, message, and confirming that you want to create the pull request (you may be asked to confirm a couple of times).

That should be it!

> *Note: For the example below, I copied, pasted and minimally edited text directly from the resource. This is ok, because they shared the resource under an MIT licence and I'm acknowledging them, but for this exercise I would like you to use your own words as far as possible.

## library(osfr) for interacting with the [Open Science Framework (OSF)](https://osf.io/) from R

[library(osfr)](https://docs.ropensci.org/osfr/) is an R package that allows you to interact with OSF directly from R. OSF is a free and open source project management repository designed to support researchers across their entire project lifecycle. The service includes unlimited cloud storage and file version history, providing a centralized location for all your research materials that can be kept private, shared with select collaborators, or made publicly available with citable DOIs. You can use library(osfr) to explore publicly accessible projects and download the associated files — all you need to get started is the project’s URL or GUID (global unique identifier). library(osfr) can also be used for project management by creating projects, add sub-components or directories, and uploading files.

## Lisa DeBruine and Dale Barr (2021) "Data Skills for Reproducible Research" 

Producing reproducible research requires learning certain skills and tools which allow for efficiently managing your data and record details of your analysis. DeBruine and Barr first show how to create a project in R Studio and the benefits for your reproducible workflow in doing so as you have a clear filing system which makes reading in data easy, for example. Secondly, an introductory tutorial on R Markdown is covered including how to embed exploratory visual analyses, such as figures, and tables, and preliminary analysis results in your R Markdown script. Finally, citing statistical packages is covered, which is essential in making the process of your data analysis more transparent and easier to replicate.

## Kellie, D. and Westgate, M. (2023) Improving code reproducibility: Small steps with big impacts, Research Communities by Springer Nature. Available at: https://communities.springernature.com/posts/improving-code-reproducibility-small-steps-with-big-impacts (Accessed: 12 February 2024). 

This is a short blog about reproducible research. It mentions how despite the push to make data openly available, these studies are still not reproducible. Despite tools being developed to aid improving reproducibility, the authors argue that alongside an academics busy schedule, it doesn't seem realistic to go through the time and effort to learn these tools. Subsequently, the authors find it frustrating how learning these tools are often the solution provided by papers to aid reproducibility. As creators of such tools to aid the reproducibility of the Atlas of Living Australia, the authors have learnt much about code reproducibility and share three achievable steps to increase reproducibility: have a shareable work environment (i.e. use code and repositories); ensure you code and notes are understandable and lastly, save your code (including wrangling steps) as a document, preferably with Quarto. The latter for sharing, efficiency and if code breaks. 

This blog raised the relevant issue of not knowing where to start to improve reproducibility. There are many suggestions before, during and after data collection, with many aided with complex tools. This can quickly become overwhelming, causing one to avoid reproducibility altogether. To avoid this, three straightforward steps within the coding process were presented, offering a practical starting point to enhancing reproducibility. Additionally, this blog being published in Research Communities, a forum for people interested in research, enhances its importance. Raising awareness to research-orientated people will help to create a culture of reproducibility.

## Powers *et al.* (2019) "Open science, reproducibility and transparency in ecology" 

Powers et al. (2019) outline “open science” as the best standard both for individual researchers and broader science. Open science they define as the sharing of code, data and metadata and continuous public communication, which roughly coincides with the definition of reproducible research in other papers (e.g. Peng 2011) although Powers et al. (2019) stresses the use of social media and online forums. This allows “peer review on the fly” they argue, which makes the final study more rigorous than it would otherwise be. They note the difficulties with reproducing ecological studies and the hesitancy to publicize the location of threatened species but note that the benefits outweigh the costs. These general benefits are: faster collaborations and sharing of ideas, avoiding time-wasting exercises and building public trust in governmental research agencies. Personal benefits include high citations and there is a strong tendency for the foremost scientists in any field to be the most prolific data sharers. 

Overall, Powers et al. (2019) is similar to other papers on the subject, although they are the first I have seen to emphasize public feedback during the research. This has potential to be very useful but premature exposure to the public runs the risk of circumventing the peer review process. Care should be taken to ensure continuous feedback is from appropriate sources.

## Zuduo Zheng (2021) "Reasons, challenges, and some tools for doing reproducible transportation research"

This paper outlines the context for reproducible research, and many of the challenges we have already discussed. However, it also outlines some key benfits to both the researcher and the readers. Zheng states that making research reproducible can elevate your reputation as an academic, and often comes with more citations. Once in the habit of working reproducibly, it also helps you work efficiently while reducing the probability of making critical mistakes. Benefits to the reader are that they can trust the research, it is easy to reproduce the analysis and this creates a more productive work flow.
