# Overview

_This is a minimal introduction to data management handling data in R compiled for the Biological Sciences BSc(Honours) class at the University of Cape Town._

```{r include=FALSE}
# automatically create a bib database for R packages
knitr::write_bib(c(
  .packages(), 'bookdown', 'knitr', 'rmarkdown'
), 'packages.bib')
```

## General

I provide a very brief introduction to data management. We only have a week, so this really is a minimalist introduction. I’ll focus on providing a broad overview of the general framework and motivation for good data management (and reproducible research), teaching a few practical skills along the way. 

Mostly this is not fun and exciting, but it is important stuff for any biologist to know. I’ll try my best to make it interesting! Hopefully by the end of the module you’ll see the value in it all - both for you as an individual and for science and society in general.

The core outcomes/concepts I hope you’ll come away with:

* Familiarity with the concepts and understand the need for Open, Reproducible Science
* Familiarity with The Data Life Cycle
* Some data management and handling skills

## Lectures/Discussions/Tutorials

These will be held live in person in BIO LT1 from 10AM to 12PM from the 4th to the 7th April unless otherwise announced on Vula. 

I’ll be adding to (and mostly teaching from) these online course notes as we go along.

## Deliverables
